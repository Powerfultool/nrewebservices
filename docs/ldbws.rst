Live Departure Boards
=====================

Overview
--------

The ldbws module provides an API for querying the Darwin OpenLDBWS web service. This web service
allows for querying all the basic information provided via station departure boards, and is suitable
for building applications which replicate some or all of this functionality. For more involved
projects, especially those where you wish to combine web service data with data from the Darwin Push
Port, the LDBWS Staff Version web service may well be more appropriate due to the extra fields it
provides on response objects.

Official Documentation
----------------------

The official documentation can be
`found here <https://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/openldbws/>`_. Whilst a useful resource for
the more experienced developer, experience has shown them to be somewhat lacking, and even downright
incorrect at times. This library provides detailed documentation of the individual API calls and the
response object properties, derived from the official documentation, but augmented with additional
explanations and corrections where necessary.

This library also provides a number of convenience functions which perform commonly needed
transformations on the raw data returned by the web service to make development easier for library
users.
