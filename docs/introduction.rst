Introduction
============

NREWebService is a Python 2/3 compatible library to ease working with the various Web Service APIs
offered by National Rail Enquiries for access to rail industry data. The web services this library
provides access to are:

* The Live Departure Boards (ldbws)
* The Live Departure Boards - Staff Version (staff)
* The Historical Performance Information (historical)

These APIs are provided by National Rail Enquiries under varying license terms. In order to access
them you will need the relevant API keys (which are different for each web service).

**This is not an official API client library, and is not affiliated with National Rail Enquiries or
the Association of Train Operating Companies in any way. Please do not contact them about issues
with this library. On the other hand, if you are having issues with the API itself including getting
API keys, please take this up with National Rail Enquiries, not the authors of this library, as we
don't control the API or access to it, so won't be able to help.**
